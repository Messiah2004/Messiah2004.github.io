          I'm <strong>Messiah</strong> <em>Afzalyar</em>, and I'm a 3rd-year
          <em>Electrical Engineering</em> transfer student from Patterson,
          California. <br />
          <br />
          A fun fact about me is that I am really into combat sports and I have
          met numerous fighters, including Mike Tyson and Khabib
          Nurmagomedov.<br />
          <br />
          I have a few hobbies, including music production, working out,
          reading, and traveling abroad.
